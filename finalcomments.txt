Comments
You did have several comments scattered throughout that helped orient me in your code. I would have liked to have seen more robust comments that answer "why" in addition to what, however.

Code Quality
You did well here. There really wasn't room for much encapsulation since it's a fairly straightforward process of stepping through the program, but you did well to handle the data coming in through the CSV and turn it to your own ends.

Ambition
You had a good, thoughtful README, and you did really well in articulating the big picture of this program. You also lay out interesting future directions.

Aesthetics
The program did what you wanted it to and, though there's room for expansion, was a fairly complete beginning of realizing your overall vision.
