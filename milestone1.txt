I feel like our last conversation had you a bit further ahead of the code I'm seeing in this repository, so I'm hesitant to comment too much on what I'm seeing right now. After that previous conversation, you seemed to have a sense of where to go, so I'll reiterate that here: focus on creating your own data structures—lists, dictionaries etc—from the data you're pulling in from the CSV file. Once you have that, it will be easier to have the user interact with the material.
