Macabre was created to determine one's life expectancy based on his lifestyle choices.
The most common factors for determining life expectancy include age, biological sex, drinking habits, and smoking habits.

The intention of this program is to make users aware that we are living on borrowed time.
Knowing their life expectancy might remind users to make better choices and to remember that this life isn't forever.
If you take care of the life you have, you might be able to buy yourself more time with the ones you love.

Here's how it is supposed to work:
The CSV file includes the life expectancy data for females and males, according to current age.
The CSV reader aligns the sex and age of a user according to the their answers, which then determine his life expectancy based on the mortality chart.
It then adds or substracts years off of the user's life expectancy age, according to the answers that the user gives
for the health questions.
At the end of the calculator, the user is given his estimated age and year of death.
This end result makes my calculator different from the other life expectancy calculators, because it is very specific about
the possible age and time of death, rather than telling the user how long they will. Hence, why I called the program Macabre.

I would have liked to include height and weight (BMI), diet, and exercise, but I did not find enough substantial data.
Most of the data available are statistics/percentages, have too many factors, or I could not use them for
multiple choice questions. If I had more time, I would have figured out a way to make it work.

My biggest issue was downloading a working terminal. This delayed me from fixing the bugs in this program in time.
As for the bugs I had issues with, I had to research CSVs online in order to fix them. The only minor issue left is spacing.

Overall, I believe the assignment turned out well, but I wish that I had included more factors/questions. I am frustrated that it took so much time for me to find
a terminal that could run my program, but I am satisfied with the fact that it runs.
