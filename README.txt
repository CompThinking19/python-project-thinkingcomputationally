Macabre was created to determine one's life expectancy based on his lifestyle choices.
The most common factors in other calculators include age, biological sex, drinking habits, and smoking habits.
Sometimes we are unaware that we are living on borrowed time.
I created a death calculator to remind users to make better choices and to keep in mind that this life isn't forever,
so make the best out of the time you have left.

I would have liked to include height and weight (BMI), diet, and exercise,
but I could not find substantial information to include in my calculator.
I didn't want to deal with studies that I couldn't interpret
nor had the best information to incorporate into my calculator.

Here's how it is supposed to work:
The CSV includes life expectancy data for females and males, according to current age.
The CSV reader aligns the sex and age according to the user's answers.
It then adds or substracts years off of the life expectancy age, according to the answers that the user gives
for the health questions.
At the end of the calculator, it gives the user his estimated life expectancy.
If my terminal had been working, I would have also like to estimate the year that the user might die.

One of my biggest issues with this project was running the code. I cannot remember how PowerShell works,
and all the terminals that I have downloaded in Atom either did not work or could only run code written for Python 3.
I started converting my code to Python 3 (raw_input = input, print = print(), et cetera).
However, I kept running into issues that I could not solve on my own and converted everything back.

Overall, I wish I could have figured out how to work terminal because I can't tell what it looks likes
or if it is able to do wat I want it to do.
